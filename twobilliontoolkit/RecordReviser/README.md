## Configuration

If you are going to be working with a database, one of the first things that you must do when trying to use this package is to fill in the information to establish a connection. This is needed for a couple of tools . Navigate to [/twobilliontoolkit/SpatialTransformer/database.ini](/twobilliontoolkit/SpatialTransformer/database.ini) and fill out the postgresql section

```
[postgresql]
host = 
port = 
database = 
user = 
password = 
```
This will allow you to connect to a database that you have set up, however you may need to make changes to the code or to the database to make sure everything works properly.
